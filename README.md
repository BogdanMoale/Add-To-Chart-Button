This JavaScript code snippet is designed to create an animation effect when a button is clicked. It also incorporates audio feedback using an HTML5 audio element.

## Features

- **Button Animation**: When the button is clicked, it triggers an animation effect where certain elements associated with the button move or change appearance.
- **Audio Feedback**: Upon clicking the button, an audio file is played to provide feedback to the user.
- **Animation Control**: The animation can be paused and resumed based on the button's current state.

## Code Structure

- **Button Selection**: The script selects the button element from the HTML document using `document.querySelector`.
- **Event Listener**: An event listener is added to the button to detect click events.
- **Animation Logic**: The script contains logic to handle different states of the button and trigger corresponding animations.
- **Audio Playback**: An HTML5 audio element is created and initialized with an audio file URL. Upon clicking the button, the audio is played using the `play` method.
